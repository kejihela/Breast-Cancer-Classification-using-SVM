Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to learn patterns from data and consequently improve the future experience.
Machine learning, on the other hand, is the process of getting insight from data by learning some highlighted elements from the data and then using the learnt features to anticipate a likely conclusion. As a result, machine learning is a data analysis technique that automates the creation of analytical models utilizing a variety of digital data, such as numbers, phrases, clicks, and photos.

**Background**
Between 1990 and 2000, the mortality rate for women diagnosed with breast cancer aged 30 to 79 dropped by 24%, and by 2007, survival rates for all women aged 15 to 99 were 98.8% at one year, 85.1 percent at five years, and 77 percent at ten years. Better outcomes are achieved not only as a consequence of more effective treatment options, but also as a result of the condition being detected sooner. Women should be encouraged to check their breasts on a frequent basis, become familiar with their usual appearance, be taught what to look for, and report any worrisome changes immediately.
Paget's disease of the nipple and an underlying cancer of the breast can both cause an inverted nipple. Some people have had an inverted nipple for a long time, possibly since birth, while others have had it as a result of trauma or breast infections, which may or may not be of any consequence other than breast feeding issues. The biggest concern is that recent changes could indicate a tumor underneath. In this scenario, the patient should be referred to a breast clinic right once for a thorough examination, investigations, and evaluation. Changes that are questionable.

However, the advent of numerous and sophisticated technologies have made it easy for the detection of breast cancer. Since the development of the field of Artificial Intelligence as a result of the availability of resources like Graphics processing Unit (GPU) and Data it has become extremely easy for the detection of this particular disease.

**Dataset**
A dataset of well technical characteristics suitable enough for the model to generate reasonable pattern or insights of tHe disease in question was used in training and testing of the machine learning modeL Support Vector Machine in particular
